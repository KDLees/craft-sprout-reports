 *
 * Don't edit this file, instead copy it to 'craft/config' as 'sproutreports.php' and make
 * your changes there.
 *
 * Once copied to 'craft/config', this file will be multi-environment aware as well, so you can
 * have different settings groups for each environment, just as you do for 'general.php'
